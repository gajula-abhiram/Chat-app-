This project is a comprehensive, full-stack real-time chat application. The frontend is built using React, leveraging Vite for fast development and Tailwind CSS for styling, offering features like user authentication (login/signup), viewing conversations and user profiles, participating in group chats, and sending various message types including text, images, videos, audio recordings, emojis, and replies. The backend runs on Node.js with the Express framework, connects to a MongoDB database using Mongoose for data persistence, and utilizes Socket.IO to enable real-time, bidirectional communication for instant messaging, user online status, and potentially location sharing updates.
